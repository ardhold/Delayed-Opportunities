# Delayed-Opportunities
2022 Women in Sports Data Hackathon

The "Corners" Excel file is needed in order to make all of the code work in the HackathonMarkdown.

As I looked at all the corners at the EURO, I put the relevant information into an Excel file. This can be seen in the "Corners" sheet in the "Corners" Excel file.

After I had the information I needed from the corners, I then was able to filter out the corners that had delayed shot opportunities in their sequences. This information can be found in the "Delayed" sheet in the "Corners" Excel file.
